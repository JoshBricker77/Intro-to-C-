//another attempt at writing a c++ print program from memory
//i put std iostream instead of incldue -- remember in the preprocessor you need to choose your proper libraries
//i also wrote out int() main instead of int main() remmeber ot write it properly.
#include<iostream> 
int main(){
    std::cout << "Am i writing this code correctly?" << std::endl;
    return 0;
